      <div class="row">
        <p class="col-md-8 text-justify">Monitoring Global Urban Expansion seeks to understand both the quantitative and the qualitative attributes and characteristics of urban expansion in the entire Universe of Cities, defined as all the 4,000+ cities and metropolitan areas that had more than 100,000 inhabitants in 2010. At this stage, we focus on a scientifically constructed global sample of 200 cities, consisting of roughly 5% of the universe of cities, and containing approximately one-quarter of the world urban population. The sample is stratified, representing cities in four city-size categories in eight world regions.

        Monitoring Global Urban Expansion is necessary not only to increase our understanding of cities but equally, to assist us in preparing for the next wave of urbanization. The urban population of our planet is expected to double by 2050. We can effectively prepare for accommodating this population but only if we gain a better understanding of how much land will be needed to accommodate it and how to prepare this land for orderly, equitable and sustainable urban development. At present, the global monitoring initiative consists of three phases. A brief description of the these phases is given below:</p>

        <h3 class="text-left sub-heading">Phase I: The Atlas of Urban Expansion — The 2015 Edition</h3>
        <p class="text-justify">The Atlas provides satellite-based maps of urban extent and their associated metrics— including built-up area, built-up area density, fragmentation, and compactness—for a global sample of 200 cities for the years 1990, 2000 and 2013.</p>

        <h3 class="text-left sub-heading">Phase II: The Quality of the Urban Fabric in Expansion Areas</h3>
        <p class="text-justify">The quality of the urban fabric in expansion areas is determined through an intensive mapping effort that measures (1) the share of land in arterial roads and access to arterial roads; (2) the share of land in streets and the distribution of street widths; (3) the share of land in residential areas in different stages of the housing sector evolution (atomistic housing, informal land subdivisions, formal land subdivisions, and housing projects); (4) average block size and the density of street intersections; and (5) plot dimensions in land subdivisions. </p>
      
        <h3 class="text-left sub-heading">Phase III: The Land and Housing Survey in the Global Sample of Cities</h3>
        

        <p class="text-justify">The Land and Housing Survey in the Global Sample of Cities has two objectives. The first objective of the survey is to obtain information on the regulatory regime governing the development of residential land and housing on the urban fringe, a regime than can be detrimental in ensuring that residential land remains plentiful, affordable and accessible and that development on the urban fringe is orderly, so as to facilitate the provision of public works as well as public transport. The second objective of the survey is to ascertain whether residential land and housing in the city are indeed plentiful, affordable, and accessible.</p>
