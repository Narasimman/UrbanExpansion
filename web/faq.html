        <h2 class="heading-blue text-justify">FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS</h2>
        <p class="question text-justify">What is the purpose of the surveys?</p>
        <p class="text-justify">The purpose of the surveys is to monitor urban expansion and look more specifically at the rules and regulations governing the development of new residential land and housing, their enforcement and the affordability and access to jobs of housing units and residential plots. </p>

        <p class="question text-justify">How do the surveys inform the Urban Expansion Program and produce knowledge on urbanization and cities?</p>
        <p class="text-justify">The surveys represent integral parts of the Urban Expansion Program. The other phases of our global monitoring effort -- the new Atlas of Urban Expansion, the Quality of Urban Layouts in Expansion Areas and the Population and Urban Extent Projections for all 4,000+ Cities, 2000-2040-- complete this larger effort to monitor and present solid empirical data on actual urban expansion and its key attributes in cities around the world over long periods of time. This data can demonstrate the extent, the form, and the context of global urban expansion, and suggest how and by how much they are likely to grow further in the future. </p>

        <p class="question text-justify">How will the results of the surveys inform city officials, planners and policy makers?</p>
        <p class="text-justify">The surveys are part of a larger effort to monitor the state of the worldâ€™s cities in a more scientific manner, so as to enable municipal and national governments, as well as civic groups and international organizations, to engage more effectively in evidence-based planning and policy-making especially when it comes to urban expansion.</p>

        <p class="question text-justify">How will the surveys be conducted?</p>
        <p class="text-justify">The surveys will be completed by city-based researchers with knowledge on each of the cities in the sample. The city-based researchers will be supported by regional coordinators and survey leaders, based in New York. The project will be conducted under the supervision and guidance of Shlomo Angel, Senior Research Scholar and leader of the NYU Urban Expansion Program.</p>

        <p class="question text-justify">Why was my city selected?</p>
        <p class="text-justify">Your city is part of the stratified global sample of 200 cities in our sample.  Our sample is stratified into three strata: eight world regions, four city population size categories, and three groups of countries with different number of cities. In general, the sample is drawn with the urban population in mind: it seeks to focus on urban dwellers rather than on cities. The sample thus contains 5% of the cities in the universe and 27% of the urban population in the universe. We have conducted a statistical test to determine whether the sample is truly representative of the universe of cities by checking whether the mean population growth rate in the sample is the same as that of the universe as a whole. We can say with 95% confidence that the two are not different from each other. </p>

        <p class="question text-justify">Will my answers remain confidential? </p>
        <p class="text-justify">Your answers to the survey will be confidential and the survey team guaranties full confidentiality. That said, if you would like to be acknowledged for your participation in the survey, we can list your name as one of the contributors.</p>
